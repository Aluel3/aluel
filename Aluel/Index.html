        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>What to Know about Aluel</h2>
        <h3>Aluel Arou is a rising junior pursuing Public Health and Biology at Agnes Scott College.
            Her career interests are in Epidemiology and Biostatistics. In first and second year, Aluel
            immersed herself in learning and applying concepts in Epidemiology, Genetics, Statistics,
            Bioinformatics, Public Health, and Chemistry. In the last academic year, she worked for
            Resource Center for Math and Science as a Statistics and Biology tutor. Last summer,
            Aluel launched a Community Action Project (CAP) where she trained 10 high school
            students on the risk factors associated with traditional ways of treating jaundice patients
            through extensive education on the underlying causes of jaundice in Bor, South Sudan.
            She also had the opportunity to participate in SolarSPELL piloting program in South Sudan
            as a South Sudan Summer Project Intern. During her internship, she trained teachers from
            middle and high school on how to navigate SolarSPELL, a portable solar powered
            educational learning library designed for use in areas without physical libraries, and
            facilitated monitoring and evaluation. Aluel enjoys consuming much of her evening hours
            at dining hall(Evans) speaking to friends, loves watching movies and shows, reading books,
            and posing for pictures.</h3>
